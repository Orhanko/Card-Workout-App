# Card-Workout-App
### My first simple iOS Application wrote completely programmatically using UIKit.

- The goal of the application is to give the user the opportunity to set a training exercise based on a random card selection.

> Learned how to make custom UIButton class, with configuration, UIImages within it and styling, and implement it on several buttons in code.

> Learned how to use Auto Layout when customizing certain Views (`UIImageView`, `Label`, `UIButton`) on ViewControllers

> Learned how to implement Timer class and to schedule work to happen repeatedly

> Learned how to implement button actions, and how to use buttons for presenting some other ViewController
